      This is a dandelion flower <i>(Taraxacum officinale)</i>. These are the most common type of dandelion you will see around. 
      
      As you can see, a flowering dandelion will most commonly have a bright yellow flower sitting atop it's stem.

      This is a dandelion seedhead. After a certain amount of time, the yellow dandelions will change into these fluffier looking plants. 
      The fluff, in fact, are actually seeds. These seeds will eventually be blown away by wind or eaten by animals in order to disperse and make more dandelions somewhere else.
