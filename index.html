    <h1>Plant Guide</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the plant guide, where we list off plants that you may want to identify.
    </p>
    <h2>Dandelions</h2>

    <p>
      This is a dandelion flower <i>(Taraxacum officinale)</i>. These are the most common type of dandelion you will see around.<br>As you can see, 
      a flowering dandelion will most commonly have a bright yellow flower sitting atop it's stem.

	<p>
      This is a dandelion seedhead. After a certain amount of time, the yellow dandelions will change into these fluffier looking plants.<br>The fluff, in fact, 
      are actually seeds. These seeds will eventually be blown away by wind or eaten by animals in order to disperse and make more dandelions somewhere else.
    </p>
      <h2>Milkweed</h2>

	<p>
      Milkweed <i>(Asclepias lanceolata)</i> is a plant most commonly grown for butterflies. Butterflies (mostly monarch butterflies) are very fond of this particular plant.<br> They commonly lay eggs in the leaves and use the 
      bright red
	  flowers on top for nectar. There is, however, a certain species of milkweed called Tropical Milkweed that can affect a monarch butterfly's migration pattern, so it is not reccommended to use that type of milkweed.
